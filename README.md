ssh-keygen-couples
==================

This script takes an ssh public key file, extracts key data, and prints
fingerprints. The script displays key fingerprints as:

- SHA256
- MD5
- ASCII representation of the SHA256 hash
- Four couples names and cities inspired by a [2006 talk by Dan Kaminsky][0]

Usage
-----

    $ ./ssh-keygen-couples -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    SHA256:XrvNnhQuG1ObprgdtPiqIGXUAsHT71SKh9/WAcAKoS0
    MD5:2c:b8:ca:b7:07:4a:40:b7:30:42:91:6e:24:70:13:3f
